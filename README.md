# Ethical-AI-for-Social-Media-Monitoring
building a responsible AI system to classify social media comments as ethical or unethical using RoBERTa, a transformer-based NLP model. This project addresses the growing need for transparent, accountable, and bias-aware AI in content moderation.

üîç Project Overview
Social media platforms face increasing pressure to moderate content responsibly. This project proposes a framework that combines natural language understanding with ethical considerations, allowing AI to flag potentially harmful or unethical content in real time.

‚ú® Features
